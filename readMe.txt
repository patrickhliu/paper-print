Paper Print Project

Project Details:
Trying to teach myself angular js and some html5 canvas drawing.
Create a website where users can print out different paper templates.
Templates so far...
1) Graph Paper
2) Birthday Card
3) Lined Paper

Languages: HTML5 / CSS / vanilla JS
3rd party: Angular JS

So far, the templates are only for letter size, 8.5" x 11"


When printing...
1) Turn off headers/footers/margins in the browsers printer settings.
2) Enable background color printing

Needed Improvements:
1)  The b-day card print preview issues...
    Firefox & Chrome: 3 pages displayed instead of 2.  First page is blank.
    IE: page 1 has this tiny top margin that pushes everything else down.
