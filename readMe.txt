Paper Print Project

Project Details:
Trying to teach myself angular js and some html5 canvas drawing.
Create a website where users can print out different paper templates.
Templates so far...
1) Graph Paper
2) Birthday Card
3) Lined Paper

Languages: HTML5 / CSS / vanilla JS
3rd party: Angular JS

So far, the templates are only for letter size, 8.5" x 11"


In Print Preview, you need to manually turn off header/margin in the browsers printer settings;
in order for each paper type to print on the entire page.

Needed Improvements:
- b-day card print preview issues...
  Firefox: 3 pages where page 1 is blank / background color not showing
  IE: page 2 is "pulled up" a bit on page 1
  Chrome: 3 pages where page 1 is blank
