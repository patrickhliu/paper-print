Paper Print
****************
This is a random project to try to teach 
myself Angular JS & HTML5 canvas drawing.	

Project Details:
	Create a website where users can print out graph / lined paper.

Hosted Link:
	http://pliu82.github.io/paper-print/#/

Instructions:
	There are 3 templates: graph paper / lined paper / birthday card. 
	So far, the templates are only for letter size, 8.5" x 11"
	When printing...
	1) Turn off headers/footers/margins in the browsers printer settings.
	2) Enable background color printing for the birthday card.

Languages: 
	HTML / CSS / Vanilla Javascript

3rd Party Tools: 
	Angular JS

Helpful Resources (many thanks):
	- Angular JS documentation

Needed Improvements:
1)  The b-day card has print preview issues...
    Firefox & Chrome: 3 pages displayed instead of 2.  First page is blank.
    IE: page 1 has this tiny top margin that pushes everything else down.
